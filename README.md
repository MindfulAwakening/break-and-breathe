# Break & Breathe — v2.5

### Fixes
- Top buttons not clickable: raised `z-index` for header/controls so nothing overlaps.
- Voice picker reliability: multiple retries, 'Reload Voices' button, and loading triggered on first user click (Safari quirk).

### Keep
- Voice picker + quick female/male pick
- Voice controls: Rate, Pitch, Volume (persisted)
- Guided Voice cues and “It is time to take a break.” reminders
- Work Hours, recurring breaks, stretch pre-alert
- PWA offline support
